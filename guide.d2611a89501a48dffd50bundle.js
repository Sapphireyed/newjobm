Switching jobs (after the first free switch), using ability cards to do damage, heal, buff, debuff etc are all based on the AP available. With so many possible actions, but so little AP, knowing how to manage your AP is very important.Some actions require AP, but you can switch jobs to use their active ability for free once each turn. It’s free, and we recommend using these to your advantage.<br><br>Getting, Regaining, and Maintaining AP:<br>AP is regained each round, and you start each round with 3. It can be increased via certain classes, Agility Combos (explained in the combo section), certain Abilities Cards and discarding Ability Cards. Each Ability Card can only be discarded once per turn (unless reset via AGI combo), and gives +1 AP upon being discarded.Certain debuffs will also reduce your AP - Chilled, for example.<br><br>What are Jobs:<br>Jobs are the classes in Job Mania and each comes with a different starting deck of Ability Cards. Each job also may come with Passive and/or Active abilities which could activate at the beginning, during or at the end of the battle. The Jobs themselves can be anything from straight up damage, to healing, buffing/debuffing, DoTs etc with many flavors in between. Each Job has a rank, with 1 Star being a basic Job to 5 Star being the highest tier. Jobs can also be combined with certain items to create new, higher tier Jobs.<br><br>Job Switching:<br>When starting a run, you will be given a choice of a starting job. This job will determine what Ability Cards you have access to in the beginning. Once the run starts, you will be given a second class that of which is randomly picked from all unlocked Jobs. Having two jobs allows access to Job Switching. Certain jobs have active abilities with each activating during the swapping of Jobs. Each swap will trigger the listed ability with the first three swaps costing 0 AP. However, each swap     will cause the Job to cost 1AP more than the previous activation.There are also “Job On” Abilities to think about during Job Switching.Any passives which specify “Job On” require that job to be the middle/main job.<br><br>Obtaining New Jobs:<br>There are many Jobs available in Job Mania and to get them, knowing how to Combine Jobs is the key. When first starting Job Mania, the only available job is “Jobless”. In order to get different Jobs, the “Jobless” Job must be Combined with certain Materials to create new Jobs. The first batch of Materials are sold in the Market for 4,000 gold apieceEach of the newly created Jobs will each branch out and require multiple different Materials to Combine with for an even more diverse set of Jobs. Farther Materials can be obtained within theGacha for either Gold or Crystals.In case you didn’t understand something, please press/hold press that location OR tap the  “?” icon around it to read the in-game description.";var u=document.createElement("img");u.src=h,l.append(b,d,u,c);var m=document.createElement("div");m.id="tips";var f=document.createElement("h2");f.innerHTML="Beginner Tips";var w=document.createElement("p");w.innerHTML='Things to know when you first start:<br><br>1.) After you craft a job for the first time, it can potentially show up in your subsequent dungeon runs.<br>2.) The market/gacha only stocks abilities from categories that you have unlocked (i.e., insane, wind, fire, etc.) These new ability types are unlocked by clearing missions, which are purchased in the market.<br>3.) You can bring 1 ability into the dungeon as a 1-use item, and it will remain in your deck throughout the entire run.<br>4.) You can set a job loadout for the dungeon and force only the jobs in the loadout to spawn by crafting over 10 jobs in any * category, and then filling out a loadout slot via the book icon on the job page.<br>Remember to hit "set" if you do this<br>5.) Your starting "deck" is based on the job you chose at the beginning of the run. These basic cards will remain even if you swap out your initial job during the run.<br>Your deck can only be edited by acquiring new cards (merchant, encounters), or by removing cards (merchant, curse removal fairy).<br>6.)
